# Batch Run Bypass
Batch Run Bypass (BRB) is a simple and easy to use batch file that allows you to run any program without admin permissions.
You will most likely be familliar with this code if you have any prior hacking knowledge.

**How to use BRB**

If you are running Windows 10 21H2 or earlier these instructions may not work.
To use BRB, simply type out the following batch code in an empty .txt file:
```
set __COMPAT_LAYER=RunAsInvoker 
start programnamehere
```
Replace "programnamehere" with the name of the .exe program you wish to run.
Next, click "File" then "Save As" and set "Save as Type" to "All Files".
Now add the .bat file extension to the end of your file's name, and double-click your newly created batch file to run your favorite programs without needing admin permissions!

Alternatively, you can just download BRB directly from this repository and change the "programnamehere" text to match your desired exe file.
